# MNIST Digit Classification – Error Analysis Project
This project implements a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, with a strong focus on model evaluation and error analysis rather than headline accuracy alone. 

## Problem
Given 28×28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), predict the correct digit label for each image.

## Results
Currently in progress.
- Created confusion matrix to analyse predictions.
- Precision vs recall analysis.
- Roc curve plot.
- Visual grid showing selection of false positives, true positives, false negatives, and true negatives.
